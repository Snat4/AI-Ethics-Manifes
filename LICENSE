Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the author and other rightsholders (each and all, an "Author") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain Authors wish to irrevocably waive and/or exercise only some of the rights granted to Authors by these laws, or to grant certain other persons rights to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, perform, and/or display their Work, without compensation or the need for further permission, while retaining their own moral rights, or other personal rights, as Authors.

To achieve this, and to help ensure that their Work can be used, reproduced, distributed, modified, performed and/or displayed by anyone, anywhere, in any way, and for any purpose, certain Authors elect to apply this Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (hereinafter, "CC0") to their Work.

By applying CC0 to a Work, an Author irrevocably releases the Work into the public domain, to the fullest extent allowed by law, granting an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license to the public to do any act restricted by copyright law, including, but not limited to, the rights to reproduce, distribute, modify, perform, and display the Work in any medium or format, and to sublicense these rights to others, without any terms or conditions.

The Author waives and/or disclaims any and all moral rights and other personal rights that may prevent others from exercising the rights granted herein, to the fullest extent allowed by law.

If the Work or any portion thereof is protected by copyright or other rights not addressed by this CC0 dedication, the Author offers the Work into the public domain to the fullest extent permitted by law by waiving all of his or her rights in the Work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.

The Author understands and intends that this dedication is an irrevocable, perpetual dedication, and that no additional terms or conditions may be applied to the Work by the Author or by others.

For any portion of the Work not covered by this CC0 dedication, the Author asserts that he or she has the right to license such portion of the Work under CC0, and if the Author does not hold such rights, the Author makes this dedication to the extent of his or her rights.

If any provision of this CC0 dedication is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be construed to be severable from the remainder of this CC0 dedication, and the remainder shall remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

This CC0 dedication does not affect any rights held by third parties in the Work, and does not place any restrictions on the use of the Work by third parties.
